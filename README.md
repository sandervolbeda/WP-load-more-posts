# WP-load-more-posts
Load more posts by clicking on load more posts button. Using jQuery only, no AJAX.

## Step 1:
Pull this repository

## Step 2:
You can just copy the code and css, but if you want to make adjustments you've got to 
run npm install in the terminal in this directory.

>npm install

## Step 3: 
Copy the code from the index.php page into your WordPress page and uncomment the loop.
You've got to deleted the following comments:
> // !!!! -- UNCOMMENT START -- !!!!

and

> // !!!! -- UNCOMMENT END -- !!!!

## Step 4:
Check if you get the posts

## Step 5:
Copy the Javascript file from assets/js/scripts/load-more-posts.js and insert in to your project. 
To check if it works refresh the page where the code is on and hit the load more button.

You might have to adjust some of the jQuery paths to make it work in your WordPress theme.

## Step 6
Hopefully it all works, you can either write your own styling or copy mine from assets/css or 
assets/scss/partials/loard-more-button.scss. Make sure you leave the ID as it is!
